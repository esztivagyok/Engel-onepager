          {/*About*/}
          <strong>Engel Organization</strong> was founded in <strong>2015</strong> with the purpose to make those
          lives better who got a bit forgotten about by society.
          <br />
          Our activities embrace three different groups of people:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Helping mentally and physically disabled people</strong> to integrate by
            employment opportunities and various programs that help them feel
            more appreciated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organizing trips and summer camps for children</strong> from poor families,
            together with our disabled community to allow children raise their
            social sensitivity towards ‚Äúthe different‚Äù. We also collect
            clothing, food, Christmas presents for these families.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Giving homeless people the opportunity to live in non-functional
            RV-s</strong> where they can heat meals, sleep in comfort and meet hygiene
            standards in order to be able to get a job, with a small plot to
            keep a dog or grow plants.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <button className="donBtn" onClick={handleClickScroll4}><strong>Donate</strong></button>
